### Python 
This repository works as a day-to-day repo for any quick analysis I might do in the future or some simple functions I might create to try different python packages. 
Nothing really important here. 
I am not a robot.

#### File structure
- src : requirements.txt, packages, things that have to do with the virtual env used
- scripts: small analysis, functions, etc. Mostly, jupyter notebooks or python scripts.
